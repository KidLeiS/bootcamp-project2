  To search for a recipe, type the search keyword or ingredient (or a mix of both) in the search bar, and then indicate your required dietary intolerances and press the search button. The application will then search against Spoonacular's recipe database, and produce a recipe with ingredients required and instructions for you.

  You can also download the recipe as a .txt file on this screen.

  ## Contributing
  Feel free to take this code and build something else. This is a relatively simple project so we will not be updating it!
